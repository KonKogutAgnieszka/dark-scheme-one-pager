            Experience Design Is Storytelling 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Imagine coming back from a vacation and meeting up with friends for the first time. You share stories about the trip and how relaxing it was, the great accommodation, the authentic pizzeria around the corner, and the exciting day trips. Enthusiasm. Joy of life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, <span class="decoration">experience design is storytelling</span>. We aren't developing solutions for positive results in questionnaires - we are designing for great stories.  
        </p>
        <p>
            What's missing from that story? That the destination and accommodation were suggested by an algorithm; that the booking could be confirmed with just one click on the smartphone; that the pizzeria was recommended in the handy guest guide and that there was an app for the region that made it easy to plan and book day trips without getting stranded.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to <span class="decoration">empower humans</span> to experience memorable stories.

        <h1>A Journey Worth Taking</h1>
        <p>
            A while back, I stumbled across the <a class="underline" href="">Process of Design Squiggle</a> by Damien Newman, and it keeps steering me back to this analogy ever since. As well as in design, the journey to a human-centered, action-integrated experience starts messy, elaborating and discarding ideas till the sky clears and the ideal solution evolves.
        </p>
        <p>
            This process can be challenging, exhausting. But it's the <span class="decoration">prologue</span> to a great story, and I am convinced that it is worthwhile.

        <h1>On A Personal Note</h1>
        <p>
            I'm neither a design guru nor a coding crack - but I understand and can bridge both worlds. Besides being a father and husband, I'm led by the ideas of sustainable, human-centered digitalization and user experience design.</p>
        <p>
            With my team, I deliver carefully crafted <span class="decoration">digital solutions for humans</span> - structured, autonomous, solution-focused, and with a keen eye for detail. With my calm, open-minded nature and quick perception, I serve as an anchor in interdisciplinary collaboration, addressing challenges openly and directly at all times and trying to empathize with the perspective of my counterpart. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Elaborating, developing, optimizing products and services that solve a defined problem as straightforward as possible; working with and connecting people with all kinds of backgrounds, expertise, and individual perspectives; making everyday life delightful, smooth, and pleasant regarding human-technology interaction 
        </p>
        <p>
            - that's what I'm <span class="decoration">striving</span> for.
